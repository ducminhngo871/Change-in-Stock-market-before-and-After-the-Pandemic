# Which section and company changes the most after the pandemic?

During this project, we aim to find the differences between different companies within the top 3 of every sector in the S&P 500 to see which company thrives and which company falls after the pandemic. We track its market cap, volume, price per share to see the key differences between these 11 fields. 

To complete the project, the first step for us is to crawl the information about the top companies in the US. We started by finding the top market cap in the S&P 500 on Yahoo Finance. We then continue with our analysis and visualization by creating time series analysis to see the changes within the period of time for these companies. We also try diffrent types of graphs, including line graph, bar graphs and area graphs to further visualize the information. 

Overall, we found out that after the pandemic, there has been a surge in price per share as well as market cap for companies within the technology as well as consumer discretionary fields such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple or Disney. Meanwhile, companies in the Energy fields such as BP, ExxonMobil saw a downward trend significantly. 

For further analysis, we would need to analyze a longer trend to see whether it is an ongoing trend or this is a rising trend that happened solely because of COVID-19 pandemic.
